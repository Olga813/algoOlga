will next (in txt file) statements compile?
1) byte b = 100 YES 

2) byte b = 100L NO 
Can be corrected:
long b=100L 
or byte b= (byte)100 L(Here the data will be lost, but we are omitted to go to this) 

3) int i = 100L NO  
Can be corrected:
int i =100 
or int i = (int)100L

// This was based on a decision: byte =8 bit; long (L)=64 bit; int =32 bit
